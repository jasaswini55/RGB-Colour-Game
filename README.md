# RGB-Colour-Game

A simple RGB Colour game to improve your RGB identification skills! 
Every colour on the screen can be represented using an RGB colour (Red, Green, Blue) code. 

For instance the RGB colour for:\
Red is (255,0,0)\
Green is (0,255,0)\
Blue is (0,0,255)\
Yellow is (255,255,0)\
Orange is (255,165,0)

Using the RGB colour code we can identify 2^24 colours: thatâ€™s 16,777,216 unique colours!

The player's task is to guess the colour in RGB form!
Instructions are listed in web application as well.
