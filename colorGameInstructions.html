		What is RGB?
	</h1>

	<div>
		The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green,
		and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.
		The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.
	</div>

	<h2>
		Your goal is to select the correct colour out of the 6 colours that matches with the RGB color listed
		in the title of the game!
	</h2>

	<h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
	<div>
		If you were to guess what colour RGB(240, 2, 201) is, what would you guess?
	</div>
	<br />
	<div>
		Well, since it has 240 red and 201 blue and very little green, looking at the RGB picture above,
		we can see that a mix of a lot of red and blue gives a pinkish colour.
	</div>
	<br />
	<div>
		As you can see: <span id="rgb_col">RGB(240, 2, 201) is the color below</span>
	</div>

	<h4>Now, using this logic, it's your turn to improve your RGB identification skills!</h4>
